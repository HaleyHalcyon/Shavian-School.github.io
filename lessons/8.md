The letter for **ch**a is <mark>𐑗</mark>. If you say "t" before "sh", you'll notice that this is basically the "ch" sound in English. Now check out how the "cha" letter looks in comparison to "tan" and "shy"!

```
tan + shy = cha
 𐑑  +  𐑖  =  𐑗
```

The letter for **ou**nce is <mark>𐑬</mark>. Your mouth sort of looks like this letter when you say it. You're like a tiger ready to pounce on an ounce of food.

The letter for **aur**a is <mark>𐑹</mark>. Note that "aura" here is pronounced like the common English word "or".

You should notice the following: 

```
ought + roe = aura
  𐑷   +  𐑮  =  𐑹
```

If you speak in the British Received Pronunciation, then "ought" and "or" ("aura") are pronounced with the same vowel sound. Indeed even "sought" and "sort" are homophones for you.

However, if you speak in a General American Pronunciation, you may notice that "ought" and "or" ("aura") are pronounced differently.

For this reason, you should think of 𐑹 as being it's own letter, separate from 𐑷. Or at least think of the combined 𐑮 as changing the quality of the 𐑷 sound.
