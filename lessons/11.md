## Nouns

### Singular

### Plurals and Genitive

Both plurals and the genitive case (possessive case) are formed in the same way. You add one of the following to the base: -𐑩𐑟, -𐑟, -𐑕

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑟 | ·𐑤𐑦𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 |
| -𐑟 | ·𐑕𐑑𐑱𐑕𐑦𐑟 𐑛𐑪𐑜𐑟 |
| -𐑕 | ·𐑡𐑧𐑓𐑕 𐑒𐑨𐑑𐑕 |

Some plurals have irregular formations. They will not change (eg. "deer") or they will change vowels (eg. "men").

Try to guess what this says: ·𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟
